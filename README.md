# Spark Streaming Playground

Welcome to the Spark Streaming Playground! This project showcases various aspects of Apache Spark
Streaming, providing a hands-on environment to explore stateful computations, structured streaming,
utility functions, and integrations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages, each focusing on different functionalities within
Spark Streaming. Below is a detailed overview of each Java class and its purpose:

### 1. **Advanced Package**

- **StatefulComputations.java**  
  This class demonstrates how to perform stateful computations using Spark's
  `MapGroupsWithStateFunction`. It utilizes Spark's stateful operations to maintain and update state
  information across streaming batches, enabling complex processing tasks like aggregations and
  transformations that rely on historical data.

- **Watermarks.java**  
  In this class, watermarks are implemented to handle late data in streaming applications. It allows
  Spark to manage event time and define thresholds for when data can be considered too late for
  processing. This is crucial in scenarios where data arrival times are unpredictable.

- **EventTimeWindows.java**  
  This class focuses on processing data within defined event time windows. It leverages Spark's
  time-based windowing functions to group data by specified time intervals, allowing for aggregate
  computations over the window of time in which the events occur.

### 2. **Structured Streaming Package**

- **StreamingDatasets.java**  
  This class introduces the concept of streaming datasets, illustrating how to create and manipulate
  datasets that are continually updated. It integrates Spark's Dataset API to facilitate operations
  on streaming data in a structured format, enhancing readability and performance.

- **StreamingJoins.java**  
  Here, the class implements streaming joins between datasets. It demonstrates how to perform
  real-time joins on streaming data, ensuring that related data from different sources can be
  combined seamlessly during the streaming process.

- **StreamingDataFrames.java**  
  This class provides functionality to work with streaming DataFrames, focusing on the differences
  between static and streaming DataFrames. It emphasizes the importance of managing the schema and
  applying transformations to the streaming data efficiently.

- **StreamingAggregations.java**  
  This class covers various aggregation functions applied to streaming data. It showcases how to
  compute aggregations like counts, sums, and averages in real-time, emphasizing the continuous
  nature of streaming data processing.

### 3. **Utilities Package**

- **SparkUtils.java**  
  The utility class that simplifies the creation and management of Spark sessions. It provides a
  flexible approach to configure Spark applications, ensuring ease of scalability and testability
  for future extensions.

### 4. **Integrations Package**

- **IntegratingKafka.java**  
  This class illustrates the integration of Spark Streaming with Kafka. It demonstrates how to
  consume and produce messages from Kafka topics, facilitating the seamless handling of streaming
  data sourced from a message broker.

### 5. **Common Package**

- **Schemas.java**  
  This class defines schemas used across various DataFrames and Datasets. It encapsulates the
  structure of the data, ensuring consistency and reliability when processing structured data.

- **Stock.java**  
  This class represents a model for stock data, encapsulating the properties and behaviors related
  to stock information within the application.

- **Car.java**  
  Similar to the Stock class, this class models car data, defining its attributes and any necessary
  methods to manipulate car-related information in the streaming context.

### 6. **Low Level Package**

- **DStreams.java**  
  This class provides a low-level abstraction for working with DStreams (Discretized Streams) but it
  has been deprecated.

## Conclusion

The Spark Streaming Playground serves as a valuable resource for exploring the capabilities of
Apache Spark Streaming. By examining the various classes and their functionalities, users can gain
insights into stateful processing, structured streaming, and integrations with external data sources
like Kafka.
